            <h2>What to do when you hate networking</h2>
            <p>In a world that discourages bragging, networking can feel like a chore, but you are awesome and
                letting people know that can help you find an awesome new role.</p>
                So:
        </div>
        <div id="box2">
            <ul>
                <li>Make a master document of all your achievements so you don't have to come up with something on the spot.</li>
                <li>Draft some common interview responses and build in examples from your master list.</li>
                <li>Ask how you can help, if you want someone to provide value to you, the best thing you can do is provide value to them. This way, when you ask for a favour they're more likely to think of you positively and want to help.</li>
