            <p>Coronavirus or COVID-19 was first found in Wuhan, China. 
            In a few months from its first appearence it spreaded throughout the globe, it has been declared a pandemic as it caused thousands of people die.
            Based on what we currently known about it, COVID-19 spreads most frequently among close contacts between people (within about 2m). 
            It is also possible that it can be transmitted via surfaces.
            The governments around the world implemented drastic measures to control the pandemic. 
            Also in Great Britain we must control the spread of the virus, in order to protect the NHS and save lives.

            <ul> The government requests you to not leave home if you or someone from your household has any of the following COVID-19 symptoms: 
                <li> A high temperature, </li>
                <li> A new, continuous cough, </li>
                <li> A loss of, or change to, your sense of smell or taste. </li>

            <ul> There are also other things that the public can do to minimise the spread of the virus: 
                <li> Do not leave your house unless necessary, </li>
                <li> Work from home if you can, </li>
                <li> If you have to go to work, avoid using public transport, </li>
                <li> Enjoy public parks but stay 2m apart from others, </li>
                <li> Wear face masks in shops and other enclosed spaces. </li>

        <h4> Coronaviurs on surfaces </h4>

        <div id = "box4">
            <p> Coronavirus can survive on surfaces for a couple of days. 
            For that reason you must educate yourself how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 both outside and inside your house.
            It is important to clean not only your hands but also high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas 
            (e.g. light switches, tables, phones, handles, desks, toilets, sinks).
            To make it easier for you, we prepared the brief guide below on how long COVID19 can stay on most common types of surfaces. 
            Soap, bleech and Hydrogen peroxide are proved to be effective when it comes to killing the virus.</p>
