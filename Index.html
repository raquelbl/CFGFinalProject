                <h3 style="text-shadow: 5px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.5); text-align:center;"><strong>When did the UK lockdown start?</strong></h3>
                <h3 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 100; text-align:center; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">Prime minister Boris Johnson announced the UK lockdown on March 23. 
                    The measures introduced were some of the most draconian the UK has ever faced and resulted in a huge shift in how people behave.
                    The initial lockdown rules were enacted by new legislation that gave the government powers to impose upon people’s freedoms. 
                    At the start, lockdown rules said people could only go outside for four reasons (food shopping, exercising alone, medical issues, 
                    and providing care and could not meet with other people. People who were vulnerable were asked to shelter for 12 weeks.
                    The changes were a stark escalation of the government's response to the pandemic. On March 16, people had been told to avoid all non-essential contact with others and four days later, 
                    on March 20, all bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants were closed. Subsequently all schools and childcare facilities, except for the children of key workers, were closed.</h3>
                <h3 style="text-shadow: 5px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.5); text-align:center;"><strong>What are the new lockdown rules?</strong></h3>
                <h3 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 100; text-align:center; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">On May 31 the government published 
                <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/558/regulation/2/made">legislation</a>that legally changes the lockdown – this arrived in the form of The Health Protection 
                (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2020. The regulations remove many of the early lockdown rules, including the ban on people leaving their 
                homes without a reasonable excuse, removed police powers to direct people back home and also took away the power for police to fine people for being outside without a reasonable
                excuse. More significantly the new regulations and government guidelines allow people greater freedoms than at any point since before the lockdown began. From June 1, 
                people in England are allowed to gather in up to groups of six – as long as they are outside and follow social distancing guidelines of staying two metres apart. 
                These gatherings can take place in people’s gardens, as well as outside in parks and other private spaces. The changes mean people can see members of their family. 
                People are allowed to enter and move through someone else’s house if they are doing so to access a garden. Politicians have said this means BBQs are allowed but people should 
                wipe down items that are passed to each other and stay socially distanced at all times. It has also been said people can use the toilet inside the houses of the gardens 
                they are visiting but should also disinfect surfaces they touch after doing so. However the new lockdown regulations say people are not allowed to gather inside the houses of others. 
                This includes staying overnight at another house. Also on June 1, schools in England started to reopen. Pupils in nurseries, reception, year one and year six will be able to start returning from this date. 
                Outdoor markets and car showrooms will also be allowed to reopen in England. These changes were announced on May 25. While some professions have started to return to work –
                including those working in food production, construction, manufacturing, logistics, distribution and scientific research – the government is still urging people who are able 
                to work from home should continue to do so "for the foreseeable future". People who have to travel to work should avoid public transport where possible and it is recommended 
                that people wear face coverings, including masks, when they are in enclosed public spaces, such as on public transport.The process of easing the lockdown started on May 10 
                when Johnson detailed several stages and steps of the UK's coronavirus plan – these were detailed in a 60-page plan. From May 13 people have been allowed to take “unlimited”
                amounts of exercise; play some sports outdoors and meet with one person from a different household, as long as it is outside. Weddings have been cancelled, prisons were put on 
                lockdown with external visits cancelled. Although funerals have still been allowed to take place they have been limited to a person's immediate family. This includes spouses 
                and partners, parents or carers, plus siblings and children. Where a grandparent has died, grandchildren can attend and if a person does not have any relatives, a close friend 
                may attend.</h3>
